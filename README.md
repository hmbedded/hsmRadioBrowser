# HsmRadioBrowser
Command line programme aimed at developing a simple menu system to retrieve radio stations from the community driven radio-browser service: https://www.radio-browser.info

The menu is based on that used on a Roberts WM201 internet radio. This device uses a module from the company Receiva who also provided a radio station database. Unfortunately both the company and the database are now defunct so it's not possible to browse radio stations from the Roberts anymore.

Ultimatey this project will be used to develop a raspberry pi zero based module to replace the Receiva module. Therefore in addtion to the command line interface it will need to drive a 132x64 3 line graphics display, take input form a rotary encoder and an infrared remote control.
