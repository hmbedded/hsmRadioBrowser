# Todo List
1. Randomise server list after retrieval and roll to next in list in case of failure.
2. Clear Location Menu before building a new one otherwise it's a memory leak.
3. Possibly only rebuild menus periodically via a timeout system rather than on every access.
4. Make menu names consistent with Roberts WM201.
